#Tech blog

Soon to be found at tech.harrywinser.com


## Further Reading
Website is written using express.js, and currently using Mustache templates. I plan to move it away from this templating and instead use React.js and attempt to create an 'isomorphic' website - i.e. it can run with or without javascript on, and will change accordingly!

#Datasource
Data is all taken from harrwinser.com. The current URL it's running from is 'harrywinser.com/articles/type/blog', where i plan to replace blog with Tech. I'll also update my main site so that it doesn't contain anything on it to do with technology.

Oh, and i totally need to fix the layout of the API... it's pretty grim...
